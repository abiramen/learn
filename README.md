# learn.abiram.me

This is the source code for my teaching website which I hacked together very quickly, where I intend on hosting resources such as code and slides for any students of my tutorials.

It's heavily inspired by @insou22's [teach-web](https://github.com/insou22/teach-web) and @spanishpear's [teach](https://github.com/SpanishPear/teach).

Changes are deployed on push to main.
